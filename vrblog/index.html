        <h1 class="rossi">Valentino Rossi</h1>
        <p> Valentino Rossi, the ultimate idol of international motorbike racing, is one of the most talented
and successful motorbike racers ever. Harboring a passion for race at a very young age, he won his
first world racing title at the age of 18. Since then, he never missed a race and has been making
records, one after another. Undoubtedly, he is on the track to becoming a motorbike legend or
rather, he is one already! The Italian sensation who turned 42 this year, is also known for being a
tad superstitious, especially, before competing in any race. His pre-ride rituals, as they are
called, include bending down and holding the right-side foot-peg of his bike with his head bowed.
For this he once made a statement, "It’s just a moment to focus and ‘talk’ to my bike, like moving
from one place to the next." Today, he is one of most famous celebrities and is one of the greatest
sportspersons. His achievements in the sport make him the most successful racer ever. However, this
coveted racer is quite discreet about his personal life and likes to stay off the radar.</p>
